Here are the changes we made to the source code:

To add a pop up box when hovering over import button:
tooltips.cpp: lines 828-830

To add the import button to UI:
tool_bar.xml: lines 116-126

To add label to volume controls:
mixer_column_volume_gain.xml: lines 40-43

*** We were not able to link our import button to the function to open a music directoy; however, the function to do so can be found in:
dlgpreflibrary.cpp: lines 206-215

To run executable, type ./mixxx in terminal
